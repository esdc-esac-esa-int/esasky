Until the middle of the last century, this region was completely unknown to astronomers. To find out why, load the visible (optical) map, and zoom out until the field-of-view is about 12\u00B0 (the size is indicated in the upper part of the screen). What does this region look like in the optical? Why was the Galactic Centre so difficult to observe? What do you expect to find if you observe it in the near and far-infrared?"}]
