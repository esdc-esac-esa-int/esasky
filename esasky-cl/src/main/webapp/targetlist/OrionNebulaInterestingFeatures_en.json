The discovery of these objects was a complete surprise and there are more than 30 pairs in the regions, some as small as 1+1 Jupiter mass. It is not at all obvious how these form.

    "description": "This is a zoom into some of the so-called “fingers” emanating from the BN-KL star-forming region behind the Trapezium Cluster and visible Orion Nebula. These fingers are expanding rapidly at hundreds of kilometres per second away from an explosive event that took place in BN-KL 500-1000 years ago. Each of the fingers comprises a series of bright arcs of emission like bow waves, expanding behind tips, the latter often appearing green. The fingers are red because they emit in shocked molecular hydrogen and the green tips are due to ionised iron. There are many stars spread across the region with the characteristic eight spikes due to diffraction in the optics of JWST, and there is a foreground haze of wispy blue clouds due to the Orion Nebula, which lies in front of the fingers.

The star is white and is surrounded by the elliptical dark shadow of its disk, with bright red material streaming away from the disk on the bottom side and a mix of blues and greens on the top side. The disk is being heated and evaporated by the Trapezium stars, forming a colourful tail of molecular and ionised gas. These glowing gases are shaped into a tail streaming away towards the upper right, with the reds, blues, and greens slowly fading and blending.

The disk of gas and dust swirling around a young star is seen edge-on, obscuring the star, and appears as a silhouette against the bright background light of the Orion Nebula. But some of the light from the star reflects off dust above and below the plane of the disk, giving rise to the colourful strips of light, like seeing a city over the horizon due to the reflected light in the sky. This disk is roughly 10 x larger than our solar system. The image displayed is a Webb NIRCam short-wavelength colour composite.",
